Eurasia group is a comprehensive webpage providing detailed information about the company in both Russian and English. This project highlights my ability to create multilingual applications that cater to a diverse audience.

The site features essential company statistics, general information, and clearly defined goals, offering visitors a complete understanding of the company's mission and achievements. Additionally, it includes recent posts with pagination, allowing users to easily navigate through the latest updates and announcements.

A standout feature of the site is the 'Contact Us' form, which is implemented with React Form Hook and Yup for thorough validation. This ensures that all submissions are accurate and complete, enhancing user interaction and engagement.

The project follows a well-structured approach, utilizing services, utilities, and page routing. Next.js is used for server-side rendering (SSR), ensuring fast load times and improved SEO. The design is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience across all devices, from desktops to smartphones.

For the UI, the MUI library is employed to deliver consistent and visually appealing input elements. The use of Axios ensures efficient data fetching from the backend server, keeping the content dynamic and up-to-date.
